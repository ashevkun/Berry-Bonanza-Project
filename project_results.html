                    <ul>
                        <li>Main berry data was acquired from Natural Resuorces Finland. Original data had Finnish ETRS89 coordinate 
                            system it has been converted to WSG84 system by using 
                            https://fmnh-ws-prod.it.helsinki.fi/tipu-api/coordinates. Due to variation some coordinates can be slightly differed then the origin one.</li>
                        <li>The weather and precipitation data was acquired from 
                            https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-api/timeline-weather-api/.</li> 
                        <li>Forest data was acquired from https://opendata.luke.fi/dataset/national-forest-inventory-nfi-vmi12.</li>
                        <li>Regions` data was acquired from https://api.bigdatacloud.net/data/reverse-geocode-client?latitude={lat}&longitude={lon}&localityLanguage=en.</li>
                        <li>Analysis were performed after combination of these data sets.</li>
                        <li>Main berry data set consist of around 360 data for bilbery, 300 data for lingon berry and 175 data for cloudberry. 
                                So data set is not balanced in terms of berry types.</li>
                        <li>Observed years are 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022</li>
                        <li>Due to data does not contain any metric information analysis were done based on only berry observations which caused limited analysis.</li>
                        <li>Visual Studio Code is the open-source software which has been used during data analysis and plotting with Python language via Pandas and Seaborn modules.</li>

                        <p>Cloudberry:</p>

                        <li>Berries grow on different types of swamps (with or without trees). Typically best harvests are in Lapland and Middle parts of Finland (Pohjois-Pohjanmaa and Kainuu)
                            Cloudberries are sensitive to days without sun and too much humidity, because pollinators won't be present as much.
                            Cloudberries are super-sensitive to subzero -temperatures, and will be destroyed by nightly low temperatures.</li>


                        <p>Bilberry:</p>
                        <li>Typically grows in spruce forest areas, especially with fresh and dry boreal forest (South Finland). 
                            Also grows on more arid boreal lands (North Finland). Bilberries typically grow in shadowy locations 
                            than in direct sunlight. Nightly sub-zero temperatures also very harmful for bilberries. 
                            Also a summer too dry is harmful for bilberries.</li>


                        <p>Lingonberry:</p>
                        <li>Grows throughout Finland in dry boreal forests but also in swamps and deep forest. 
                            Lingonberry grows best in sunlight and forest, where the trees don't block the sun 
                            too much for the berries. Lingonberry is not as sensitive to nightly subzero 
                            temperatures due to later growing season than bilberry and cloudberry.</li>

                        <li>Lingonberry observation consecutively increased over the years.</li>
                        <li>Bilberry observation was minimum in 2019 and maximum in 2020.</li>
                        <li>Cloudberry observation has the less volatility over the years.</li> 
                        <li>Data set consist of 375 data for bilbery, 310 data for lingonberry and 171 data for cloudberry.</li>
                        <li>So the data set is not balanced in terms of berry types.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>2018 is the driest year.</li>
                        <li>2020 is the most precipitation occured year.</li>
                        <li>2019 lowest temperature and precipitation occured year; accordingly less berry observation, especially lowest cloudberry 
                            observations among the years.</li>
                        <li>It is quite difficult to make analysis regarding berries` connection to precipitation due to the following reasons;</li>
                        <li>In 2018 precipitationcover was lowest but precipitation is similar to 2020, 2021 and 2022,</li>  
                        <li>In 2020 precipitationcover is the highest but in 2022 precipitaton is the highest and generally total berry observation is similar, 
                            while bilberry observation is the highest with small difference in 2020.</li> 
                        <li>Precipcover variable gives the daily non-zero precipitation information and it cannot effect the observation immediately.</li>
                        <li>Precip varibale gives information about precipitation that fell or is predicted to fall in the period but it would be much 
                            more better if the whole year precipitation data was present for better comparisons.</li>
                        <li>In this regard weekly observations do not give valuable results though.</li>
