WEATHER

temp –      temperature at the location. Daily values are average values (mean) for the day.
dew –       dew point temperature             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point
            "The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor, 
            assuming constant air pressure and water content. When cooled below the dew point, 
            moisture capacity is reduced and airborne water vapor will condense to form liquid water known as dew.[1] 
            When this occurs via contact with a colder surface, dew will form on that surface.[2]

            The dew point is affected by humidity. When there is more moisture in the air, the dew point is higher.[3]"

winddir –   direction from which the wind is blowing

pressure –  the sea level atmospheric or barometric pressure in millibars (or hectopascals)

cloudcover –how much of the sky is covered in cloud ranging from 0-100%

solarradiation – (W/m2) the solar radiation power at the instantaneous moment of the observation (or forecast prediction). 
                See the full solar radiation data documentation and Wind and Solar Energy pages .

solarenergy –   (MJ /m2 ) indicates the total energy from the sun that builds up over an hour or day. 
                See the full solar radiation data documentation and Wind and Solar Energy pages .

moonphase –  represents the fractional portion through the current moon lunation cycle ranging 
            from 0 (the new moon) to 0.5 (the full moon) and back to 1 (the next new moon). 
            See How to include sunrise, sunset, moon phase, moonrise and moonset data into your API requests
